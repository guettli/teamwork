But I believe that I can learn.

This text helps me to become a better team worker.

# No hijacking

In the chat (on friday)

Someone> This new tool which we will use in the future to track the [Key performance Indicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator)of our goals has a setting for notifications. How often do we want to get a notification that we need to update our values? Once a week, on monday, on friday?...

I feel aggression. I don't want to have reoccuring manual tasks. I want it be automated. I grab my keyboard and start to write... 

BUT: Stop it! Don't to hijacking of questions.

Slow down. If you want other people ot listen to you, then the audiance should listen.
